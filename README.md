# GAUNTLET - an aim trainer you'll actually want to play

## Progress updates for class:
10/7/25: 

Adding shaders to get the retro look - 6 hours

Splitting the game into different levels and adding a score / goal to meet to proceed - 3 hours

Adding menu to change sensitivity (and creating helper functions to expose the player scene's MOUSE_SENS variable to be something that can be edited from other scenes) - 3 hours

Wireframe: (i only got the sensitivity changing part done, the crosshair editor is something I want to do more in depth later (change color, length, thickness, shape, etc)
